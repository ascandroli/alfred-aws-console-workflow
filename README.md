# Alfred Workflow for the AWS Console

Open AWS console links directly from [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

I use a a dedicated browser for AWS built using the fantastic [Fluid App](http://fluidapp.com/). 
This is the recommended way to use this alfred workflow, but if you don't have Fluid any other browser should also work.

### TODO:

* [ ] Add a script to extract and parse *"awsc-mezz-data"*.
* [ ] Add a script to rename new icons in the new icon packs.

### notes:

* The list of services is parsed out of the *"awsc-mezz-data"* meta tag in the aws console html.
* The icon pack is (AWS_Simple_Icons_EPS-SVG_v16.2.22.zip) from https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/

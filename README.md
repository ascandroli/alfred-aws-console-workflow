# Alfred Workflow for the AWS Console

Open AWS console links directly from [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

I use a dedicated browser for AWS built using the fantastic [Fluid App](http://fluidapp.com/). 
This is the recommended way to use this alfred workflow, but if you don't have Fluid any other browser should also work.

* The list of services is parsed out of the *"awsc-mezz-data"* meta tag in the aws console html.
* The icon pack (AWS-Architecture-Assets-For-Light-and-Dark-BG_20200911) has been downloaded from https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/
